# Scrabble Score Tool
Built with Visual Studio 2019 as a WPF App in C#

Replica of the scrabble-score-tool repo that was built in python. 
It has been updated from a console app in python to a WPF App. This allowed the addition of a user interface.

It is built for practice with C# and XAML, so is not actively maintained. Any suggestions on improvements are always welcome though!

The 3 folders:
 - Library - back end operational code used by the UI
 - UI - makes it look fancy and operates with calls to the library
 - Tool - VS solution file is here, this is also the original (early version) console app in C#
  
## To run the app outside of an IDE

Copy the **Scrabble Score Tool.exe** and **Scrabble Score Tool Library.dll** files to a folder of your choice (the same folder). Run the .exe file.

# Scrabble Score Tool
Built with Visual Studio 2019 as a WPF App in C#

Replica of the scrabble-score-tool repo that was built in python. 
It has been updated from a console app in python to a WPF App. This allowed the addition of a user interface.

It is built for practice with C# and XAML, so is not actively maintained. Any suggestions on improvements are always welcome though!
